# Tools

This repository contains a collection of small development tools and scripts created during my free time. Each tool is designed to solve specific problems or automate tasks, providing practical examples of scripting and coding techniques.

## Tools List

### 1. Basic Serial Connection
A simple script to establish a serial connection to a USB-to-Serial device using `screen`. This script automates the process of identifying the connected device and setting up the connection.

#### Usage
1. Ensure you have the `screen` utility installed on your system.
2. Run the script:
    ```bash
    ./basic_serial_connection.sh
    ```
3. The script will search for a connected USB-to-Serial device and automatically establish a connection.

### Prerequisites
- Bash shell
- `screen` utility
